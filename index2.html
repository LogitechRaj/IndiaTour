<h2>Goa Tourism </h2>
</font>

<p align=justify> <font face=cursive>
Lying on the western coast, Goa is India's smallest state and unlike any other, known for its endless beaches, stellar nightlife, eclectic seafood, world-heritage listed architecture. Spread across just 3,702 km, Goa lies in the Konkan region. It is a far cry from the hippie haven or a beach getaway, and one of the only few destinations that is open 24x7. The laid-backness (susegad) of Goa attracts as many international tourists as it does Indians, or even more so.
<br>

The Goans are quite friendly towards tourists and celebrate many festivals throughout the year, the most famous being the New Year and Goa Carnival. While the seafood is excellent, Goa has one of the best nightlife in India with trendy bars, beach shacks, elegant cafes and many clubs and discotheques. Thanks to lower alcohol prices in the state, Goa is also great for younger tourists with relatively tighter pockets.

<h2>Must Know Before You Travel to Goa <img src="img9.png" width="45"></h2>
</font>
<ul align=justify>
	<li>Some beach shacks and water-based activities may be shut down during the monsoon season (June to September). </li>
	<li>Pre-book accommodations, especially during the peak tourist season (November to February). </li>
	<li>When choosing accommodations, consider your preferences. South Goa offers serene beachside cottages and resorts, North Goa boasts vibrant parties, Panjim is rich in culture and heritage, and Vasco near the airport is ideal for business travelers. </li>
	<li>Some beaches in Goa, especially in North Goa, have strong rip currents, marked with red flags. Swimming in such areas can be dangerous, so heed warnings and consult lifeguards. </li>
</ul>
